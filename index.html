                I'm started coding in the beginning of the 2018. Before that, I heard a lot of programming, but I never
                tried to check what it really is. I had bad ideas in my head about programming, until I decided to see
                how it looks. HTML and CSS were first technologies I've learned, later I dived into JavaScript - and
                here the whole adventure began seriously. Seriously enough to take a life direction and get involved
                professionally. Learning by myself alone at home after hours was simple up to a certain point. Web
                Development fascinated me because it's a very huge topic with many tools. I like to learn new things
                and it's great! At the end of the year 2018, I took the infoShare Academy Front-End course to speed up
                gaining knowledge. Now, day by day, step by step, I'm developing my skills.

                    HTML markup language. Together with CSS are total basics of Front-End world. My learning began just
                    from that. I have learned HTML5 - latest version. I also have knowledge of BEM methodology, to
                    naming classes in a right way.

                    As I mentioned in HTML section, CSS is also the base of Front-End. CSS is necessary to make
                    pleasure the eyes of users. I can using FlexBox and CSS Grid for positioning elements on the page.
                    I think I can deal without these tools, but browser support for FlexBox nowadays seems to be high
                    and there is no need to wrestle with floats, clearfixes etc.

                    "Life" of websites and web apps we owe exactly to JavaScript. JS is the language of the Internet
                    and additionaly has other uses, not only on the client's side, but also on the server with Node.js.
                    As of today, basics of this language in ES6 version is not a problem for me. I can program in OOP
                    and also in a functional approach. Thanks to JavaScript, the life of the Front-End Developer is
                    starting to be fascinating. The best of all is that I can see the effects of my work instantly.
